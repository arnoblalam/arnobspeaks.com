# Covered interest rate parity

$$

(1 + i)S = (1 + i^*)F \\
\frac{F}{S} = \frac{1 + i}{1 + i^*} \\
FID = \frac{F - S}{S} = \frac{i-i^*}{i+i^*} \approx i - i^* \\
i \approx i^* + FID

$$

where :

\\(S\\) is the spot market price

\\(F\\) is the future price

\\(i\\) is the current interest rate

\\(i^*\\) is the expected future interest rate

# Uncovered interest rate parity

$$
i = i^* + \Delta s^e
$$
