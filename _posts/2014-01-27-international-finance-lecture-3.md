# Covered interest rate parity

Covered interest parity refers to the condition that the interest rates and futures prices move in such a way that any gains due to nominal interest rate differences between two countries is wiped out by the premium on the forward premium.  Formally:

$$
\begin{align*}
f &\equiv \frac{F - S}{S} \\
(1 + i)S &\equiv (1 + i^*)F
\end{align*}
$$

where:

$$S$$ is the spot exchange rate

$$F$$ is the forward exchange rate

$$f$$ is the forward premium

Maniulating some variables, we obtain:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{F}{S} &= \frac{1 + i}{1 + i^*} \\
&= \frac{i-i^*}{i+i^*} \approx i - i^* \\
i &\approx i^* + f
\end{align*}
$$

$$i$$ is the current interest rate

$$i^*$$ is the expected future interest rate

# Uncovered interest rate parity

$$
i = i^* + \Delta s^e
$$
